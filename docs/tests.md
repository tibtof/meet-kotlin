### The example application is inspired by LSL-P (Lightbend Scala Language Professional) course

 - Start from `start-demo` branch, that has no code.
 - Test files are in `.test` directory, with a number prefix for ordering (`000_TestName.kt`). 
 - Each run of `next-test.kts` will bring a new test into the project.

#### Task
Create the `next-tests.kts` script, that moves the first file (in alphabetical order) from `.tests` to `src/test/kotlin/train`.
